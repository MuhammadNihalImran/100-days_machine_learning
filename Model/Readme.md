# Machine Learning Types

## 1. Supervised Learning
- **Data:** Labeled (X + Y)
- **Goal:** Predict known outputs

### Types:
1. **Regression** – Predict continuous values  
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge, Lasso, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression
2. **Classification** – Predict discrete categories  
   - Algorithms: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)

## 2. Unsupervised Learning
- **Data:** Unlabeled (X only)
- **Goal:** Discover hidden patterns

### Types:
1. **Clustering** – Group similar data points  
   - Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models
2. **Dimensionality Reduction** – Reduce features while preserving information  
   - Algorithms: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, LDA
3. **Association Rule Learning** – Find relationships between variables  
   - Algorithms: Apriori, Eclat, FP-Growth

## 3. Reinforcement Learning
- **Data:** Feedback from environment (rewards/penalties)
- **Goal:** Learn optimal actions by trial and error

### Types:
1. **Model-Free RL**
   - Algorithms: Q-Learning, SARSA, Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
2. **Model-Based RL**
   - Algorithms: Monte Carlo Tree Search, Policy Gradient Methods (REINFORCE, PPO, A3C)
