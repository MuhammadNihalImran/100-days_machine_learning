# Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning is a type of Machine Learning where the model is trained on labeled dataâ€”each input has a corresponding correct output.

## Types of Supervised Learning

### 1. Regression
- **Goal:** Predict continuous numerical values.
- **Examples:** Predicting house prices, temperature forecasting.
- **Common Algorithms:**
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - Decision Trees (Regression)
  - Random Forest Regression

### 2. Classification
- **Goal:** Predict discrete categories or labels.
- **Examples:** Email spam detection, disease diagnosis.
- **Common Algorithms:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Decision Trees (Classification)
  - Random Forest Classification
  - Naive Bayes
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)

## Workflow
1. Collect and prepare labeled dataset.
2. Split into training and test sets.
3. Train the model on training data.
4. Evaluate performance on test data.
5. Optimize using tuning and validation.
