   1) Feature Engineering:
              feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract
              feature from raw data.
              . feature transformation (missing Value, handling categrical,outlier detection,feature Scaling)
              . feature Constraction
              . feature Selection
              . feature Extraction

     .feature Scaling:
           It is a technique to standardize the independent feature present in the data in a fixed range 
           like 100 and 10 ko 1 and -1 ki bich value mein change kr dena beacuse large difference in 100 and 10
       a) standardization 
            also called Z-score Normalization
